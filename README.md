# County Referral Hospital & Pharmacy Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project
(Professional, clear, and attractive to recruiters.)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital patient and pharmacy data to generate actionable insights for a county referral hospital. The goal is to support management in understanding patient visit trends, disease patterns, pharmacy revenue performance, and medication consumption across departments and counties.

## Dataset used
- <a href= "https://github.com/254baraka/Data-Analysis-Dashbord/blob/main/Hospital_Pharmacy_PowerBI_Assignment%20(1).xlsx">Dataset<a/>


## Questions (KPIs)
Use Power BI to clean, model, analyze, and visualize the data to support decision-making.

Key Questions to Answer
1. Which diseases are most common across counties?
2. Does a higher number of patient visits always lead to higher pharmacy revenue?
3. Which departments generate the highest pharmacy costs?
4. Are there age groups that consume more medication than others?
5. Are some diagnoses associated with longer hospital stays but lower pharmacy spending?

Dashboard Requirements
- KPI cards (Total Visits, Total Pharmacy Revenue, Avg Length of Stay)
- Disease trends over time
- Pharmacy cost breakdown by drug category
- County and department comparisons
- Slicers for County, Diagnosis, Date

Deliverables
1. Cleaned and modeled Power BI report
2. One-page executive dashboard
3. Short written insights (400–600 words)

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how raw and unstructured healthcare data can be transformed into meaningful insights that support strategic hospital management decisions. By integrating patient visit data, disease distribution patterns, pharmacy spending, and departmental performance, the dashboard provides a comprehensive operational overview of the hospital.
The analysis highlights the relationship between patient volume and revenue, identifies high-cost departments, and uncovers patterns in medication consumption across age groups. These insights can guide better resource allocation, improve pharmacy inventory planning, optimize departmental budgeting, and enhance patient care efficiency.
Overall, this project showcases strong skills in data cleaning, modeling, analytical thinking, and executive dashboard design — translating complex healthcare data into clear, actionable intelligence for decision-makers.
